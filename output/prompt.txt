I‚Äôm building a PDF-to-Excel OCR pipeline for complex French-language administrative documents. 
The documents contain tables, paragraphs, stamps, and hierarchical layouts. 
My goal is to extract structured content from scanned PDF pages, including:
clean text blocks (merged as paragraphs),
table content (row/column structure),
and then export everything into a .txt format.

‚úÖ What‚Äôs Working
The pipeline uses pdf2image to convert PDF pages to images.
layoutparser with the PaddleDetectionLayoutModel (PubLayNet) detects table bounding boxes accurately (bounding boxes visually align with real tables).
PaddleOCR is used to perform OCR on cropped image regions.
Text block detection works well using layoutparser with type filtering on 'Text'.

‚ùå The Core Issue
Although table regions are correctly detected and cropped, 
the OCR output from those regions is either empty or returns unreadable/jumbled text (e.g., [‚ö†Ô∏è No OCR result]).

üß† What We Tried
We implemented a method extract_table_from_region(image, bbox) that:
Crops the table region.
Runs PaddleOCR (ocr.ocr(...)) on that region.
Attempts to reconstruct rows/columns by analyzing text boxes and using horizontal/vertical lines with non-max suppression (via tensorflow.image.non_max_suppression).
The text extraction works well for paragraphs but not for tables ‚Äî it returns garbage or nothing.

üéØ What We‚Äôre Trying to Do Now
We want to:
Fix extract_table_from_region() so it returns clean table data from the detected bounding boxes.
Ensure OCR results are correctly parsed into rows and columns, even if they're imperfect.
Embed that into the run_pipeline() logic and export text and table content in correct order in .txt
